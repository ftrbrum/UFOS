# UFOS
Module 11


## Overview of Analysis:

After creating Dana's UFO Sightings webpage with a filter search for the date, we have gone back and added 4 additional options in the filter search.  This will allow a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter the search for the added criteria.

The additional filters added are for city, state, country and shape.
